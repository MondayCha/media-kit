## Usage Guidelines

### File Formats
- **SVG files**: Preferred for web use and scalable graphics. These vectors can be scaled to any size without loss of quality.
- **PNG files**: Best for situations where raster images are required. These are high-resolution files suitable for most purposes.

### When to Use Each Version
- **Full Logos**: Use when you have adequate horizontal space and want to showcase the complete branding.
- **Compact Logos**: Perfect for smaller spaces or when a more condensed branding element is needed.
- **Dark Mode Versions**: Specifically designed for dark backgrounds and dark mode interfaces.

## Best Practices
1. Maintain clear space around the logo
2. Don't modify or distort the logo proportions
3. Use the appropriate version for your background (light/dark)
4. When possible, use SVG format for better scaling
